# NEXT Branch

This is the rewrite of radish which might replace the original implementation some day.
As of today nobody is actively working on finishing that.

# What is radish?

radish is a Behavior Driven Development tool completely written in python. It supports all *gherkin* language features. In addition to that, radish implements a few *unconventional* BDD features such as **Preconditions**, **Scenario Loops**, **Constants** and **Expressions**.

# Installation

radish is available as `pip` package:

```bash
python -m pip install radish-bdd
```
**Note**: Make sure you have enough privileges to install radish on your system.

# Getting started
