Feature: Get User from database
    In order to test custom argument expression
    I'll do this simple example.

    Scenario: Get User from database
        Given I have the following heros in the database
            | Peter | Parker | Spiderman |
            | Bruce | Wayne  | Batman    |
        When I query for the hero with name Spiderman
        Then I expect it's name to be Peter Parker
