@constant(SomeNumber: 5)
Feature: Test summing numbers  # features/constants.feature
    In order to test the constant
    features of radish I test
    to sum numbers.

    @constant(ExpectedResult: 8)
    Scenario: Sum two numbers
        Given I have the number ${SomeNumber}
[A[K        Given I have the number ${SomeNumber}
        And I have the number 3
[A[K        And I have the number 3
        When I add them up
[A[K        When I add them up
        Then I expect the sum to be ${ExpectedResult}
[A[K        Then I expect the sum to be ${ExpectedResult}

    @constant(ExpectedResult: 10)
    Scenario: Sum three numbers
        Given I have the number ${SomeNumber}
[A[K        Given I have the number ${SomeNumber}
        And I have the number 3
[A[K        And I have the number 3
